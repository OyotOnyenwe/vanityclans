# VanityClans

Minecraft Server Plugin that seeks to create groups of players that only exist for the sake of vanity, and do not effect land protection, pvp, etc.

Ideal use case would be for marking teams or base groups on an SMP server that doesn't focus on PVP & already has land protection plugins or chooses not to use them.

Inspiration is taken from this forum post:
